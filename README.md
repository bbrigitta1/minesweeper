This is a simple Minesweeper game in JavaScript which I was made during my studies in Codecool.


    In this project I practiced:
    - recursive functions for field-opening,
    - measure time with JavaScript,
    - find and manipulating DOM elements,
    - handle user interactions with event handlers
    - change style, classname or other addributes of DOM elements
